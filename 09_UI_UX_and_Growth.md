# UI/UX and Growth Strategy (MVP Aligned)
### Camera-first product design and distribution plan for the canonical MVP

---

## Document Role

This file defines:
1. MVP interaction quality goals
2. MVP growth and positioning strategy
3. Post-MVP creative direction notes

Implementation scope is controlled by:
1. `12_MVP_Canonical_Plan.md`
2. `13_MVP_Build_Checklist.md`
3. `14_MVP_Risk_and_Decisions.md`

---

## Product Positioning

Core positioning:
"Scan the tag and item to get a fast, confidence-scored resale estimate."

Do not position MVP as:
1. "scan anything"
2. "list everywhere in one tap"

Those are post-MVP expansion narratives.

---

## UX North Star

The product should feel like:
1. camera-first utility
2. immediate result feedback
3. trust-first output presentation

MVP UX success means:
1. user understands what to scan
2. result is fast enough for in-store use
3. confidence and uncertainty are clear
4. the output is actionable for buy/pass decisions

---

## MVP UX Principles

1. **Fast:** keep the scan loop short and focused.
2. **Clear:** always show source depth and confidence.
3. **Honest:** low confidence must look and sound uncertain.
4. **Actionable:** always present a next action (save, rescan, correct).

---

## Required MVP Screens

1. Onboarding with camera permission priming and trust copy
2. Scan screen (camera default)
3. Scanning/progress state
4. Result sheet (price range + confidence + comp context)
5. Low-confidence result variant
6. My Finds collection list/detail
7. Optional eBay listing draft/publish flow (next package)

---

## Result Card Requirements

Each result must include:
1. candidate item/brand output
2. confidence score
3. range estimate (`low`, `median`, `high`)
4. comp depth indicator (`n` comps)
5. direct action buttons:
   - save
   - rescan
   - mark incorrect

When confidence is low:
1. use cautious language
2. widen range
3. prompt tag-focused rescanning
4. avoid hard sell claims

---

## Packaging and Paywall (MVP)

Use one consistent structure:
1. Free tier: 5 scans per day
2. Paid tier: advanced selling workflow and deeper usage
3. Paid messaging centers on reliability and workflow efficiency, not hype

Paywall placement:
1. after user experiences scanner value
2. never before first meaningful value moment

---

## MVP Growth Strategy

## Core channels

1. reseller communities
2. thrifting creators
3. build-in-public product clips

## Content formats that match MVP

1. tag-scan demonstrations (accurate expectation setting)
2. confidence comparison examples (high vs low confidence)
3. buy/pass decision examples from real thrift contexts

## Growth guardrails

1. no fake precision in promo content
2. no claims of universal identification
3. no claim of multi-platform one-tap listing in MVP

---

## Post-MVP Direction (Intentional, Deferred)

These remain valid design/growth directions after MVP validation:
1. broader portfolio gamification
2. richer social sharing layers
3. expanded platform listing workflows
4. stronger creator and affiliate loops

But none of these should dilute the MVP trust loop.

---

## Quality Bar for UX

Before expansion, MVP UX must prove:
1. users repeatedly complete the scan loop
2. users understand confidence output
3. users trust low-confidence behavior
4. users save and revisit results

---

## Bottom Line

MVP design should optimize for trust and repeat utility, not breadth.

If users trust the scan result card, growth and monetization layers can be added safely. If they do not, broader features will not compensate.
