# Current Thrifter Workflow and Pain Points (MVP Focus)
### What users do today and what the canonical MVP replaces

---

## Document Role

This file maps real user behavior to the canonical MVP value proposition.

Canonical MVP value:
`Scan tag + item -> confidence-scored resale range -> save/correct decision`

---

## Core Problem

In-store evaluation is slow and inconsistent.

Users often need to:
1. identify the item
2. verify resale demand
3. estimate realistic price

Most users do this with fragmented tools and manual lookups.

---

## Current Practical Workflow

Typical flow:
1. pick up item
2. inspect tag for brand
3. search sold/current listings manually
4. compare rough condition and price
5. decide buy or pass

Pain points:
1. too many taps per item
2. hard to evaluate unfamiliar brands quickly
3. confidence is low when comps are messy
4. repeated context switching drains time and attention

---

## What MVP Replaces

MVP replacement flow:
1. point camera at tag + item
2. receive confidence-scored price range and comps context
3. save result or rescan/correct

MVP objective is not to replace every downstream listing workflow yet.
MVP objective is to improve in-store sourcing decisions quickly and reliably.

## Pain Points Addressed by MVP

1. **Knowledge gap:** OCR + comps reduce reliance on memorized brand knowledge.
2. **Speed gap:** one scan loop replaces repeated manual searches.
3. **Confidence gap:** explicit confidence avoids false certainty.
4. **Decision gap:** buy/pass judgment becomes faster and more repeatable.

## Pain Points Deferred Beyond MVP

1. Multi-platform listing orchestration
2. Full cross-platform arbitrage optimization
3. Advanced inventory-to-listing automation on non-API marketplaces

These are expansion layers, not MVP requirements.

---

## What Success Looks Like in MVP

1. Users repeatedly use scan results during sourcing.
2. Users trust high-confidence outputs and understand low-confidence warnings.
3. Users can make faster buy/pass decisions with less manual lookup effort.
4. Saved scans and corrections create a usable quality-improvement loop.

---

## Bottom Line

The canonical MVP is a sourcing decision engine first.

If this loop is trusted, listing and multi-platform layers can be added safely later.
